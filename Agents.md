# Agents Guide

## Overview

This repository is an experimental playground for building a text‑based adventure game using agentic tools. The aim is to explore how autonomous agents can manage and evolve a narrative world.

## Goals

- Prototype a lightweight framework where an agent orchestrates story progression.
- Experiment with large language models and tool integrations for dynamic content generation.
- Investigate memory and planning mechanisms that allow the agent to keep track of state and player choices.

## Architecture

A basic scaffolding for the agent might include:

- **World State Manager** – maintains the current location, inventory, NPC states, and history.
- **Story Engine** – proposes narrative events based on the world state and player inputs.
- **LLM Interface** – wraps calls to language models for generating descriptions, dialogues, and branching outcomes.
- **Interaction Layer** – provides a text‑based interface (CLI or web) for the player to interact with the agent.
- **Persistence Module** – stores session data and allows saving/loading of game progress.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install any dependencies (to be added).
2. Explore the agent scaffolding under `src/`.
3. Run the sample driver script to start a simple text adventure loop.

## Next Steps

- Add a README and contributing guidelines.
- Expand the agent’s planning ability and include tool use (e.g., external APIs, memory retrieval).
- Develop tests for core modules.

Feel free to contribute ideas and improvements!
